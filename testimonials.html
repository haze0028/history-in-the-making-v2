That doesn't mean much except that I have a large collection of uniforms and reproduction clothing from Revolutionary War through WW2, including some Napoleonic Wars generals uniforms, (Russian, Prussian, British and Napoleon's) and have much to compare. Yours is as good as I could possibly want. The cut, weight, details like padding/quilting, raw edge and buttonholes, etc. could not be better done, truly a museum reproduction."

I have a two story building full of reenactment gear. I have thousands of dollars worth of period clothing. I know CW tailors around the US and have some nice officers coats. The pants and waistcoat you made me are the finest, highest quality period clothing I have ever seen. I know what to look for and what I see is skill, craftsmanship, and a care for detail. I will look forward to purchasing more of your fine clothing. Thank You for such a good job!"

I carefully tried it on with a regular white dress shirt and tie underneath and some regular clasp suspenders. It fits beautifully! -- I am so amazed that you could sort out the correct measurements from all the variations I sent you. I am ecstatic to wear this not only for the wedding but for other formal occassions in the years to come! I know immediately that this suit is a personal treasure and a long-term jewel of my wardrobe. I only wish modern clothing was so flattering! <i class="far fa-smile"></i>"

The fabric looks great. We weren't sure how the stripe would look, but it just adds to the look of the suit. We were very impressed by the workmanship on the entire suit. We loved all of the details and the striped fabric for the sleeve linings. The suit really does look like it's a vintage one."

For the price, I expected something very nice, but this exceeded my expectations! I dare say, most of the people involved in the Civil War reenacting hobby have never seen the likes of my outfit. It says QUALITY from top to bottom!"

It really is a work of art. I am amazed that you could make a product that when worn by me with a difficult body type, it comes across with an 1840's silhouette. Fantastic! It really puts this garment in a class of its own. It fits me perfect. It is the finest garment I own. Thank you for getting it here for the Dickens Holiday event this Friday. I will be the best dressed person there."

We are a French based theatre company and it took quite a leap of faith to order such an important costume all the   way from Canada, but we had read other testimonials and had the feeling that the quality was going to be really good. We certainly weren't disappointed! The tweed cloth was beautiful and of a really good genuinely 'heavy' quality. The cut and fit were perfect for all the different parts of the suit, and the little extras like the metal  fastenings at the knee just make the costume stand out from the   alternatives we could have got here for the same price. We're very glad we decided not to hire a suit, we want to keep this one and I know we   will use it again and again. Thank you Stan for always being quick to   respond to any queries I had, I would definitely put my trust in you and your company again!"
